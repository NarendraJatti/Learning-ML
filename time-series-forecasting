time series vs regression
=================== 
time series >>date(should be equal interval) is present ,date should be of some pattern ,need to conver to time series>>aggregate date colume 
ARMIA,SARIMA etc algo 

anamoly detection and  outlier dection 
==========

compoentns of time series
>trend 
> seasonlity
> irregurality
> cyclic 
techniques
decompositon(decompose) to detect components in the data 
auto corlelation
spectral analysis usig fourier series 
decison tree 
neural networks 

addtictive and mutlplicatiove decompsition
additive == trend + seasoning + residual component >>sum of components 
muliplicative == product of components,multiply together 
depends on data ,magnitude of trend and sessional components
best is to both,plot graph to select final method>addtive or multiplicative 


stationarity
=============
mean,variabnce,standard deviation reminas constant over time
we should try to make stationary>>model works best for stationary,transformatative 
,forecasted value of transformed values,need to peform inverse transfomratioon
log ,dobule log, diffenrecne>>different techingqu
stationary >>do forecasting
not stationary >>do transformation(make stationary),then forecast,then inverse 
tranform to get exact forecasted values 

to check data is stationary or not >> use ADF,KPSS etc 

testing time series (TS) stationarity
======
Facebook profit,neural profit etc alogos don't need stationarity
>look at plots
> sumarry statistis
> statiscal tests(ADF,KPSS etc)

null hypothesis(not stationary,has unit root),alternate hypothesis(stationary)
p value-parobality value 
5% error accpetable in p value 

transforation
===========
techniques
>differencing
>logarthimic
>smoothing(moving avg,expoentional smoothing)

pre processing
>1data cleaning,null values,missing values,duplicates
>data tramisforation,FEATURE scaing,standariation,encoding
