 General AI 
 ML >>AI 
 deep learning ,neural network >> ML 

 types of ML
 ===========
 suprevised >>data,label 
 classification>>binary and multi classification
 regression>>how many,how much ?
 unsupervised >no label,need to define outputs
create cluster,groups ,we need to provide label (or create groups/cluster)
 transfer learning 

 reinforcement (skill acquistion,realtime learning,rewards,penaliteis)
   

   ML algos>>called models 

   data types
   ========
   1)strucutred data ,excel,csv,format defined ,numbers 
   2)unstrcutured data ,images,videos,phonecalls,not numbers

types of evaluation (metrics)
=========
classification >>accuracy,precison,recall 
regression >MAE,MSE,RMSE 
recomendation > precison at K


faetures in data 
===========
info about data ,forms of data 
numerical faetures
categroical faetures(words)
dervied(new) feature(data)>feature enginerring 

feature coveraage >>sample data should have better data/feature spread,should avoid skewed data/features.
atelast 10 per coveraage


splitting data
========
based on data and problem>>decide which model(algo) to use 
> choosing and traning a model
> tunning a model 
> model comparision
